Two of the fire companies that attempted to put out the blaze, the Heston and Star and Salamander, clashed openly in the streets.  There were no reported deaths but several of the volunteer firemen were badly beaten and stabbed.\",

After serving as a delegate to the state Constitutional Convention of 1868, Dill won a seat in the SC House of Representatives in April of that same year.  After serving only a few months in office, Dill was induced to run for county commissioner.  During the campaign, Dill suffered much abuse in the local press and received several threats on his life.  As a result, he asked several close friends to stand guard at his home on nights leading up to the June elections.  On the evening of June 4, 1868, however, the Dill homestead was left unguarded.  Eleven men crept quietly towards the home; Four of these men stopped along the road to ambush any of the legislator’s allies who might have come to his defense.  The remaining seven men reached Dill’s house and killed the legislator and Nester Ellison, an elderly man who kept watch over the home.  Dill’s wife was reportedly wounded. Whether she died is unknown. Over twenty individuals were arrested by military authorities in connection with the crime but despite a large amount of circumstantial evidence and witness testimony, none were convicted. Democratic Party officials continued such acts of intimidation to scare African Americans out of voting Republican.\",

            \"narrative\": \"The Millican Race Riot of 1868 was arguably largest “race riot” in Texas.

    \"The conflict occurred in Millican, Texas, a town located 15 miles from the Texas A&M University campus.

    Details remain unclear, but we believe that the Klan marched through Millican, a small central Texas town on the Houston and Central Texas Railroad, on during a Sunday church service led by Pastor George Brooks, a local Methodist preacher, former Union soldier, and Union League organizer. The worshiping armed freedmen fired on the rally, driving the Klan out of town. After the rally, George Brooks began a black militia of about 200 townspeople. The white community asked Nathan H. Randlett, local agent of the Freeman’s Bureau and former union infantry Captain, to stop the militia action, but Randlett refused.

    Several confrontations occurred including the rumors of attempted lynchings. Some papers report that Miles Brown, a freedman, was rumored to be lynched, others that Andrew (or his brother William) Halliday or Holiday, a white son of a former large plantation owner, the target due to his supposed lynching of Brown. Several confrontations occurred including a march on the larger county seat of Bryan by a large group of armed blacks, which ended in an armed assault on the local black community and deaths of numerous black women, children, and men. Brooks was apparently tortured and killed. It is unclear if his body was recovered.

    Apparently the local authorities called for a militia to be formed in Bryan and sent by train to put down the “mob.” Newspapers describe the militia as being taken from the bars and brothels in the middle of the day. Newspapers also report that the black militia surrounded the local black community, patrolling the edges of the area to protect the citizens.\",

            "narrative":"The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868. It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called The Landry Progress and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.

    The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.",

Late in the evening a party of the latter went to the village on a serenading expedition, and on their return fell in with a party of Irish laborers, by whom they were violently assaulted. They succeeded in driving off their assailants, and retired to their own quarters.

    The negroes immediately collected reinforcements, and, to the number of fifteen or twenty, advanced toward the scene of the first conflict. They were met near the same spot by a still larger party of Irishmen, armed with pistols and clubs, and, after a sharp fight, were discomfited, cut off from their quarters, and forced back to Mrs. Carter’s farm. Here they obtained further help, and then endeavored to save the cabins of the first party, which had been already attacked by their assailants. The Irish, better armed and more numerous, fired upon them across a deep cut and drove them off. The abandoned cabins were pillaged, and the money which the poor fellows had received the day before, and which was mostly deposited in sachels left in the quarters, was stolen. The Irishmen then fired the cabins, and immediately got into a row among themselves, during which one of the number, named Colls, was killed, and his body left near the cabins.

    During the night the Irishmen collected reinforcements, and next morning renewed the fight. By spreading the report that Colls had been murdered by the negroes, they roused their countrymen to the utmost frenzy, and a party of about 150 made an attack on the Negroes on Mrs. Carter’s farm just at daybreak.

    Roused from sleep by the firing, the poor fellows fled in terror and confusion, closely pursued by the infuriated Irishmen. One of the negroes, Denis Powell, was shot, and left dying by the road. A portion of the fugitives sought refuge in the out-buildings around Mrs. Carter’s house, under the porch, and elsewhere about the premises. The Irish demanded admission to the house, and when the brave woman refused, they beat in the door. Just at that moment a poor old Negro was discovered crouching under the porch. He was immediately shot, dragged out, and beaten to death with clubs. After searching the premises, and finding no one, they retired. On their way back they found Powell still alive, and falling upon him, beat out his brains with clubs and stones. Spying another fugitive, Oscar Bruce, in the act of climbing a fence, they shot him down, and then, jumping upon his prostrate form, stamped it and beat it with clubs until it was unrecognizable as the remains of a human being.

Chamberlain to disarm Edgefield’s African American militia company.  Shortly thereafter an unnamed arsonist destroyed Butler’s home.  The accused perpetrator implicated Ned Tennant, the captain of Edgefield’s black militia company.  A manhunt ensued.  During the search, two African Americans were murdered and sporadic firefights took place between Tennant’s supporters and his pursuers.  Eventually, Tennant surrendered.  Shortly afterwards, Governor Chamberlain ordered the disarming of the militia and the disbanding of all other paramilitary groups in the county.  Tensions remained high; Later that year, following the death of a white woman (Lena Foster), six black men were arrested but were lynched by a mob of several hundred white men who removed them from the sheriff’s office.",

A group of about one-hundred and fifty Democrats traveled to the site by steamboat and met their political opponents at “Brick Church.”  The leadership from both sides had agreed beforehand that participants would not bear arms at the meeting, but many of the Republicans, mindful of the sort of violence that had occurred previously in places like Hamburg, arrived to the meeting with their personal firearms.  When their leadership informed them that they were breaking protocol by carrying these weapons they stowed them nearby, some in a dilapidated vestry building on the premises and others in a stand of woods.

    The meeting commenced with a speech from the Democratic candidate for prosecuting attorney of the circuit, who was followed by W.J. McKinlay, a prominent Republican politician.  Shortly after McKinlay began speaking several young men from the Democratic congregation entered the old vestry and discovered the cache of weapons stored there.  They emerged from the structure and shouted warning to their comrades while McKinlay issued a similar warning to his fellow Republicans.  Seeing armed Democrats emerge from the vestry, many of the Republicans rushed to gather the weapons that they had stored in the nearby woods.  The scene quickly devolved into chaos as both sides feared the worst intentions from the other.  In the opening melee one elderly African American man was shot dead.  After this initial casualty the bulk of the Republican group returned from the woods with their weapons and quickly outflanked the Democrat’s position.  Many of the Democrats on the scene had carried sidearms to the meeting and returned fire, but they were ultimately driven from the field.  Between three and six of the white Democrats fell dead on the field before the firing ceased.  Members of Democratic controlled rifle clubs from Charleston quickly organized and arrived on the scene in force within a few hours.  Tensions remained high, but no more organized fighting took place and a small detachment of U.S. military forces arrived a few days later in order to maintain the tenuous peace.\",

    Parish, all the while hunting for particular neighborhood leaders and other black men. It was a
    dry time of year (October), so whenever the mounted parties took off for one particular
    plantation or neighborhood, the people could see, recalled one white cotton planter, “the dust
    curled up from the road … over the tops of the trees.”30 Seeing the clouds of dust billow up in
    the distance, black men fled to the woods.31 Over the next two weeks before the election, work
    in the fields effectively came to a halt as dozens of men (and sometimes women and children)
    took refuge in the thickly forested regions of the parish, returning to their homes only at night.32
    One black political organizer recalled that the woods were so filled with men that it seemed “as
    if a lot of sheep was running through the bushes.”33 Local blacks fled to the woods not to
    organize or to reestablish community, but to find a sanctuary from the violence that claimed at

After the meeting an African American shoved one of the members and tempers quickly escalated. Even though the man apologized, many white men had already drawn pistols. A scuffle ensued resulting in seven black men dead and two whites injured (NY Times, 11/5/1883, 1). The military arrived shortly there after and the crowd dispersed. Much damage had been done, but many of the effects of the riot were not apparent until after the elections. Whites patrolled the streets after the riot with shotguns in an attempt to keep fear and submission in the hearts of African-Americans. The propaganda proved effective when the polls were tallied as 31 of the 1,300 blacks registered to vote submitted ballots (Ayers/Willis, 142). The result was a landslide victory for the Democratic Party. This event also marked the end of the Readjuster era.\",

            ""narrative"": ""In Crittenden County",
            "Arkansas",
            "Reconstruction ended when racist white Democrats in Marion forcibly expelled African American elected officials (County Judge Daniel Lewis",
            "County Clerk David Ferguson",
            County Assessor J.R. Rooks and Arkansas State Representative Sandy S. Odom) at gunpoint of 50 Winchester rifles on July 12,
            1888.  It was called"The Revolution of 1888.""The group of white who forced them to leave stated":"God damn you, you‘ve got to leave this county, this is a white man‘s government, and we are tired of negro dominance; we have been planning this for the past two years, and not more Negroes or Republicans shall hold office in this county."At that time (in 1888),
            "Republicans were the party of Lincoln and Democrats were the party of white supremacy",
            "redemption from""Negro Rule",
            "the Ku Klux Klan",
            "and the White League",
            "the Rifle Clubs",
            "Red Shirts",
            "or Knights of the White Camellia (other white supremacist groups).

    When whites in Marion expelled Black leaders at gunpoint",
            "it was right before the fall elections",
            "so this resulted in the complete loss of Black political power and the complete rise of white power.  Not only were Black elected officials expelled at gunpoint",
            "but so were prominent Black citizens. After this was complete",
            white Democrats passed the Election Law of 1891,
            "a poll tax",
            "secret ballots",
            and eventually the all-white primary (in 1905) which helped nullify the voting power of the super Black majority in Crittenden County.

    This is how Black political power and representation was destroyed after Reconstruction in Crittenden County. It is clear from the historical record that Black people in Crittenden County did have political power,
            "but through",
            "terrorism",
            "and taking the law into their hands",
            "white people in Crittenden County stole African American""s birthright. Legacy of 127 years.\",

There was only one thing we could do, and a great determination seized the people to follow the advice of the martyred Moss, and ""turn our faces to the West",

Hundreds left on foot to walk four hundred miles between Memphis and Oklahoma. A Baptist minister went to the territory, built a church, and took his entire congregation out in less than a month. Another minister sold his church and took his flock to California, and still another has settled in Kansas. In two months, six thousand persons had left the city and every branch of business began to feel this silent resentment of the outrage, and failure of the authorities to punish lynchers. There were a number of business failures and blocks of houses for rent.",

The counties mentioned are in his district, and he has recently returned from an attempt to fill his appointments. He was roughly treated. He says he was preaching in Lafayette County to a large congregation when a crowd of armed white men came into the church and stationed themselves near the pulpit. The leader asked Mr. Gillislee:

    ""How long do you expect to remain in this county and live?""

    Then the whites began to shoot, and Mr. Gillislee and the congregation ran out in a panic. Mr. Gillislee went to Branford, ten miles away, in Suane County. He made the trip in an hour. He then went to Taylor County, adjoining Lafayette on the west, but was again driven out. While preaching at night twenty white men came in and stationed themselves about the pulpit. Gillislee was greatly scared, but kept on preaching. Finally he said, ""Sinners",
            "you must be",
            "born again or go to perdition."" As he said that there was a howl from the white men and the mob shot out the lights. Mr. Gillislee and the negroes ran out, many being trampled upon.",

National protests, led by anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and George White, the last remaining Black Reconstruction-era Congressman, forced the federal government to investigate.  Thirteen men were arraigned and charged with conspiracy to violate Baker’s civil rights under the Enforcement Acts. Local whites, however, obstructed justice through perjury and appeals to the racial sensibilities of jurors. The result was a mistrial.",

    In the 1930s, Rondo Avenue was at the heart of St. Paul's largest African American neighborhood that was displaced in the 1960s by freeway construction. African Americans whose families had lived in Minnesota for decades and others who were just arriving from the South made up a vibrant, vital community that was in many ways independent of the white society around it. The construction of I-94 shattered this tight-knit community, displaced thousands of African Americans into a racially segregated city and a discriminatory housing market, and erased a now-legendary neighborhood. While the construction of I-94 radically changed the landscape of the neighborhood, the community of Rondo still exists and its persistence and growth are celebrated through events like Rondo Days and the Jazz Festival.",

Whenever the whites would see one, someone would cry, ""There is one of the black fiends""; minutes later, the ""fiend"" would be dead or beaten senseless. Among the many victims, a disabled man was chased down and beaten to death. The mob rampaged for several days before the militia restored order. Officially, 25 blacks and one white died.

This killing led to the largest known lynching in Florida history when as many as eight blacks were murdered by rampaging whites.  Boisey Long temporarily escaped, was later found, tried and hung.  Most of those who were lynched were hung from a huge ""hanging tree"" in a place that is stilled called Lynch Hammock, stands on Highway 24 right outside the city.

    Long's family members, including his pregnant wife Stella Young and unborn child, made up the majority of those lynched. Members of the powerful Dudley family were believed to have been involved in the mass killing as Constable Wynne was the brother of the matriarch of the Dudley family. Four of her sons and many other influential whites were photographed with the bodies of the victims.  The ropes used in the lynchings were reportedly tied in the kitchen of the Dudley farmhouse. The Dudley Farm is now a state park recreating early Florida Cracker life.",

Once fully armed, members of the mob fired indiscriminately into crowds of black people ducking into alleyways and scurrying for cover.” Reported to be “several thousand” strong, the mob controlled the downtown area by midnight.  By then, Black Charlestonians had armed themselves to fight back. The Marines were called in to restore order.

The mob also burned down the drugstore and other businesses in the area and prevented firemen from saving the burning buildings. By daybreak of May 10, most of the town's black businesses, as well as a residence, lay in ashes. Among the businesses burned were the offices of a dentist, a doctor, and a civil rights lawyer, William J. Durham. After the mob subsided, a detachment of militia went to the area and cut down Hughes's charred body. The owners of two black undertaking establishments that had been destroyed were offered Hughes's remains, but because they no longer had operable places of business, the remains were turned over to a white undertaker. Hughes's remains were buried on the morning of May 10 near the Grayson county farm.",

    The protests over the Moores' deaths rocked the nation, with dozens of rallies and memorial meetings around the country. President Truman and Florida Governor Fuller Warren were inundated with telegrams and protest letters.

    Despite an extensive FBI investigation, however, and two later investigations, the murders have never been solved. Harry Moore was the first NAACP official killed in the civil rights struggle, and he and Harriette are the only husband and wife to give their lives to the movement.",

During the protest, students lit a bonfire in the heart of the campus and continued to loudly call for change. Meanwhile, officers from the South Carolina highway patrol and National Guard soldiers moved towards campus. Later that evening, highway patrolmen converged on the campus to disperse the crowd and enable local firefighters to douse the flames. Accounts differ on what happened next but shortly after their arrival, the patrolmen opened fire on the students killing three and wounding twenty-seven.  Nine patrolmen were arrested and put on trial. All were acquitted. The only individual arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for his supposed role in the massacre was Cleveland Sellers, a longtime civil rights activist and former field organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.",
